                <h2 class="featurette-heading">About us</h2>
                <p class="lead">We are a small group of five students dedicated
                to making garbage disposal more confortable, more environmentally friendly
                and above all, fairer for all parties involved. These days, most London
                councils do not collect non-household waste, causing a massive increase in
                London's flytipping rate. Thus, people have had to resort to private contractors
                to get rid of their garbage.</p>
                <p class="lead">Our aim is to empower DIY-ers, gardeners, and
                small scale construction operations. We hope that our services
                will make London a cleaner and more enjoyable city to live in.

          <p class="left-align">We are a team of students at Imperial College of
          London who are currently completing their second year. We created this
          application as part of our summer term WebApps assignment. We choose
          this project because we felt that the waste disposal industry really
          needed modernisation, therefore we felt it would provide us an
          opportunity to create a product with a lot potential market value.
          Also we felt that implementing Kerb.It would be a very challenging,
          yet rewarding and educational experience for us. Apart from being
          passionate programmers we like to party loads, so if you ever need to
          contact us, just go to the Imperial College Union or Belushi's in
          Hammersmith and you are bound to find one of us.</p>
